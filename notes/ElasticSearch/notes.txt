Perfect question 👏 — and this goes to the heart of how Elasticsearch indexing actually works under the hood.

Let’s go step-by-step and make it super simple and clear.

🧩 Step 1: MongoDB vs Elasticsearch — Their Roles

MongoDB = your main database (stores the source of truth)

Elasticsearch = a search engine (optimized for fast search, text matching, filters, ranking)

When a new document is created in MongoDB (for example, a new attendee record),
you also send that same data to Elasticsearch via your function:

await elasticClient.index({
  index: AIM_EVENT_ATTENDEES,
  id: attendee._id.toString(),
  document: elasticData,
});


This process is called indexing.

🔍 Step 2: What “Indexing” Actually Means in Elasticsearch

When you “index” a document, Elasticsearch:

Stores the JSON document in its own index (like a table)

Analyzes each text field (tokenizes and normalizes the text)

Creates an inverted index

Let’s explain that part 👇

🧠 Step 3: The Magic — Inverted Index
Normal index (like MongoDB)

If you think of MongoDB:

It’s optimized for document lookup via exact filters (find({ email: "abc@gmail.com" }))

It can use B-tree indexes for fast lookups on certain fields.

Elasticsearch inverted index:

Elasticsearch builds a search-friendly index.

Example document stored:

{
  "id": "a123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@gmail.com",
  "organization": "TechCorp"
}


Elasticsearch processes this into something like:

Token	Document IDs
john	a123
doe	a123
gmail	a123
techcorp	a123

So now, if you search for "john" or "techcorp",
Elasticsearch instantly finds all document IDs linked to those words.

⚡ That’s why it’s extremely fast for searches —
because it doesn’t have to scan the whole data; it just looks up tokens in this index.

⚙️ Step 4: When You Search

Let’s say you search for "john".

Your search query is:

{
  query: {
    bool: {
      must: {
        multi_match: {
          fields: ["firstName", "lastName", "email"],
          query: "john",
          fuzziness: "AUTO"
        }
      },
      filter: {
        term: { eventId: "e001" }
      }
    }
  }
}


Elasticsearch does this internally:

Parses “john”
→ finds token john in its inverted index.

Looks up all documents that have that token in any of those fields
→ finds a123 (our attendee).

Computes a relevance score (_score) based on:

How frequent the term appears

Which field it matched

Fuzziness (if any)

Filters (like eventId)

Returns the matching documents with their _source data.

So Elasticsearch returns:

{
  "hits": [
    {
      "_id": "a123",
      "_score": 1.2,
      "_source": {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@gmail.com"
      }
    }
  ]
}

🔁 Step 5: Sync Between MongoDB and Elasticsearch

You typically maintain synchronization like this:

Event	Action in Elasticsearch
New doc created in MongoDB	Call .index() → add new ES document
Doc updated in MongoDB	Call .update() → update ES index
Doc deleted in MongoDB	Call .delete() → remove from ES index

That’s how Elasticsearch stays in sync and can always search the most recent data.

🧭 Step 6: Putting It All Together
Example flow:

User registers for an event → MongoDB creates new record

Your app triggers indexing → pushes that record to Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch:

Parses and tokenizes text fields

Creates internal inverted index mappings

When you search → ES looks up tokens → returns matching documents

✅ So when you type “john” or “techcorp” in the search box,
Elasticsearch can instantly return a123
— even if MongoDB would take much longer to search via filters.

🧠 Analogy (Simple Version)

Think of Elasticsearch like a dictionary or Google index:

When a new web page is published → Google “indexes” it (analyzes words, stores references)

When you search for “John Doe conference” → Google doesn’t read the page again
— it looks up the pre-built word index.

Same for Elasticsearch.
