The Problem You’re Seeing

You said:

if I use route '/' and after that any route will be there, it will point to '/'.

✅ Correct — and here’s why that happens.

⚙️ 1. app.use() Matches Prefix Routes

app.use(path, callback) is middleware, not a strict route handler.

That means:

It matches every route that starts with the given path.

It doesn’t care about the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).

It runs in the order you define it.

So when you write this first:

app.use("/", (req, res) => {
  console.log("Home");
  res.send("Home");
});


It matches all requests —
because every URL path in Express starts with /.

That means:

/ ✅ matches

/home ✅ matches

/about ✅ matches

/contact ✅ matches

So, the first middleware handles the request and ends the response with res.send("Home").

Since the response is already sent, the request never reaches the next handlers.

🧠 2. Express Routing Order

Express executes middleware top-to-bottom.

So in your code:

app.use("/", ...);  // runs first
app.use("/home", ...); // never reached
app.use("/about", ...);
app.use("/contact", ...);


When /home is requested:

Express sees / matches /home (because /home starts with /).

It executes that first function.

You send a response (res.send("Home")).

Request ends — it doesn’t check further routes.

That’s why all routes respond with "Home".
